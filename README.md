## [32KB RAM Expansion](/Sharp_MZ-80B_RAM_III_IV_Expansion)
Internal expansion board to increase the RAM from 16KB to 48KB.  This design is from the Service Manual and so currently uses 4116 RAM chips.<br>

## [8KB Graphics RAM Expansion](/Sharp_MZ-80GMK)
Expansion board that connects to the internal Expansion Port (MZ-80EU) that doubles the graphics video RAM from 8KB to 16KB.  This design is from the Service Manual but uses a 32KB 62256 as these are still available new, rather than an obsolete 8KB 6264 or four 2KB 2016.<br>
