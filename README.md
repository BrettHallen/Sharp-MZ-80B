# Sharp MZ-80B
My little repository of information about Sharp's MZ-80B all-in-one business computer from 1981.<br>

The MZ-80B is an evolution of the MZ-80K.<br>

WORK IN PROGRESS.<br>

## Specs
- Z80 at 4MHz (LH0080A)
- Power: ±5V, +12V
- 32KB RAM, expandable to 64KB
- 2KB ROM (Initial Program Loader, IPL)
- 2KB Character Generator ROM
- 2KB Character RAM
- 8KB Graphics RAM, expandable to 16KB (MZ-80GMK)

## [Manuals](/Manuals)
- MZ-80B Service Manual
- MZ-80B User Guide

## [ROMs](/ROMs)
- 2KB Initial Program Loader (IPL)
- 2KB Character Generator
- BASIC for EPROM expansion board

## [32KB RAM Expansion](/Sharp_MZ-80B_RAM_III_IV_Expansion)
Internal expansion board to increase the RAM from 16KB to 48KB.  This design is from the Service Manual and so currently uses 4116 RAM chips.<br>

## [8KB Graphics RAM Expansion](/Sharp_MZ-80GMK)
Expansion board that connects to the internal Expansion Port (MZ-80EU) that doubles the graphics video RAM from 8KB to 16KB.  This design is from the Service Manual but uses a 32KB 62256 as these are still available new, rather than an obsolete 8KB 6264 or four 2KB 2016.<br>

## [DRAM to SRAM](/Sharp_MZ-80B_DRAM-to-SRAM)
Idea to replace the 16 x 4116 DRAMs of the original 32KB RAM plus the additional 16 x 4116 DRAMs of the expansion RAM with two 62256 SRAMs.<br>

WORK IN PROGRESS.<br>
